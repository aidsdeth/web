                    <h1>About Me!</h1>
                    <p>My name is Aidan Patrick Dethlefs and I have quite a few roles. I am currently a Support Team Intern at Kitepipe,
                    I am a full-time student at WGU studying Computer Science, and most importantantly a Father. Kitepipe is a Boomi Elite Partner and I help provide level II support
                    to their clients. I am currently enrolled at Western Govenors University and working towards my B.S. of Computer Science. I have wanted to puruse a career in IT/CS
                    for most of my life as this has always been my passion. I have always been fideling with computers and learning all I can about them. I have found that there is only
                    one thing in IT and CS that is consitent, and that is learning. To me, this is the most attractive thing about this field of work. I will never in a million years
                    stop learning and expanding my skill set. I am still a novice in this field. Still I have made quite a few accomplishments that I am very proud of, this website 
                    being one of them. Recently I was about to start a family of my own, this is my biggest, proudest accomplishment. This family is my #1 priority above all else.</p>
